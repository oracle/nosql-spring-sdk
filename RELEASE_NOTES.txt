      Oracle NoSQL SDK for Spring Data
              Release Notes

= INTRODUCTION =

This document contains the release notes for this version of the Oracle NoSQL
SDK for Spring Data. Oracle NoSQL SDK for Spring Data provides a Spring Data
implementation module to connect to an Oracle NoSQL Database cluster or to
Oracle NoSQL Cloud Service.


= Supported Java Versions =

The Oracle NoSQL SDK for Spring Data requires at least Java SE 17. It has been
tested with Spring Framework version 6.0.16 and with Spring Data version 3.1.2.


= Supported Features =

- Generic CRUD operations on a repository using methods in the CrudRepository
interface. See <link: https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/commons/docs/current/api/org/springframework/data/repository/CrudRepository.html>
- Pagination and sorting operations using methods in the
    PagingAndSortingRepository interface. See
    <link: https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/commons/docs/current/api/org/springframework/data/repository/PagingAndSortingRepository.html>
- Derived Queries.
- Native Queries.
- Support for projection on derived queries. Returned type, instance or
class, must be a subset of entity type properties. Only the top level properties
of the entity are selected in the projection. Note: Projections usingÂ @Value
annotations are not supported. Dynamic projections, when returns type is
parametrized, are also not supported.
- Support for IgnoreCase and AllIgnoreCase keywords for derived query methods.
- Support for fields of Java enumeration types.
- Support for java.util.Map and similar types as mapping types.
- Support for evaluating SpEl expressions on NosqlTable.tableName annotation.
- Support for table level default TTL.

For a complete list of changes by release see CHANGELOG.md.

= Known Issues =

- Automatic generation of UUID for String fields is not available in Cloud
service. The workaround is to have "@NosqlId(generated = false)" and application
should make sure the field has a valid value when used.
